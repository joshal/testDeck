# The Problem

 * [Going green](http://www.fueleconomy.gov/) is good, knowing how to go green is better!
 * A lot of [research](http://www.nasa.gov/offices/ipp/centers/dfrc/news_events/SS-Truck-Aerodynamics.html#.U5abm3Wx15Q) is being carried out to improve fuel economy 
 * With so many options to choose from, buying a fuel efficient vehicle can be a tough choice
 * **Question:** Can we predict the miles per gallon of an automobile from it's weight?

# The Solution: The Data Model

 * Historical data on car fuel economy given it's weight is available
 * Sophisticated prediction models can be computed fast given today's computing power
 * We fit a linear prediction model to the given data of car weight and MPG
 * The least squares fit to the solution contains the line $Y = \hat \beta_0 + \hat \beta_1 X$ where,
    $$\hat \beta_1 = Cor(Y, X) \frac{Sd(Y)}{Sd(X)} ~~~ \hat \beta_0 = \bar Y - \hat \beta_1 \bar X$$

# The interactive tool: A Shiny app

 * We have the capacity to predict the MPG (as $Y$ in the model) from the weight (as $X$ in the model)
 * Imagine a GUI tool which can help a customer know the fuel consumption of a vehicle
 * We present a very user-friendly web tool using a Shiny app in R proramming language:
 https://joshal.shinyapps.io/code/
 * The data is predicted using the `mtcars` dataset available in R

# Conclusion

 * We have addressed a unique and interesting problem of predicting fuel consumption of a vehcile
 * We presented a solution by providing an easy-to-use tool built using Shiny
 * We observe that fuel efficincy decreases as the weight of a vehicle increases
